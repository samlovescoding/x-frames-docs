# Testing

Your application can be tested using PHPUnit. You can create
a custom test using the CLI. You have full access to PHPUnit
Library and can perform all the tests on the application.

Tests should not present on a server. Run `npm run build` to
remove PHPUnit Library and dont upload the Tests folder to
the production server.
