# X Framework

X Framework offers a service based approach towards software
development. Using the XFrames Library, you can build 
amazing website back-ends in no time.
It literally has close to no footprint and yet provides the
structure as that of laravel. We try to keep things consistent
with laravel and other web frameworks that we take inspiration
from.

## About X Framework

Ever wanted to use Laravel without the expensive footprint. X Framework is a heavily inspired framework based upon the concepts of Laravel, CodeIgniter and Django. X Framework is designed to build elegant apps faster. It takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Routing
- Dependency Injection
- File System
- Database, Query Builder, Models
- Eventing
- Front-End Integrated
- Command Line Interface

## Learning X Framework
