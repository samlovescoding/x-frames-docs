# X Framework

X Framework offers a service based approach towards software
development. Using the XFrames Library, you can build 
amazing website back-ends in no time.
It literally has close to no footprint and yet provides the
structure as that of laravel. We try to keep things consistent
with laravel and other web frameworks that we take inspiration
from.
